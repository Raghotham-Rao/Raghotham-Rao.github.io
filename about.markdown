##### **More about me**
I like and enjoy programming in python. Be it a project I take up or a leetcode question i need to solve, python is my go-to language.

Early morning bike rides are a low-key habit of mine. The streets of Bangalore are really refreshing before the 8 a.m traffic. 

I enjoy playing. I've had some exposure to playing cricket in my school and college days and it's the sport that I follow the most. Badminton has lately become a very regular activity of mine and thing's have gotten really competitive leading to an app to track stats. I occasionally also play football but wouldn't bet on myself to score a penalty :sweat_smile:.
